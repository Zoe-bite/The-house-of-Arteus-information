<p> Pelops was the son of Tantalus who was killed and butchered. After his revival he was made king of Siplyus. He is celebrated as being the legendary founder of the Pelopid dynasty at Mycenae in the Greek Peloponnese, which was probably named for him. His reign was largely uneventful and peaceful when in consideration of his two sons, Arteus (for whom the lineage is named) and Thystes’ reigns. Pelops best known myth (apart from the myth depicting his death by his fathers hand) is one depicting a chariot race he took place in to win the hand of his wife. Pelops’ union with his wife, Hippodamia, led to his family being the rulers of Mycenae. He is remebered as a good, and strong king.<p>
