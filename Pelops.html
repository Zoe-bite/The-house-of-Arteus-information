<p> Pelops was the son of Tantalus who was killed and butchered. After his revival he was made king of Siplyus. He is celebrated as being the legendary founder of the Pelopid dynasty at Mycenae in the Greek Peloponnese, which was probably named for him. His reign was largely uneventful and peaceful when in consideration of his two sons, Arteus (for whom the lineage is named) and Thystesâ€™ reigns. Pelops best known myth (apart from the myth depicting his death by his fathers hand) is one depicting a chariot race he took place in to win the hand of his wife. He is remebered as a good, and strong king. There is also another version of the myth of Tantalus' where Pelops absence is caused Poseidon taking him to Olympos rather than his father killing him. In this version of the myth Poseidon and Pelops were lovers, and the myth of the feast was mearly rumour to explain his disappearance. Tantalus' was punished for stealing from the gods in this version.<p>

<div>Pelops' wife was Hippodamia, the princess of Pisa. Hippodamia's father, Oenomaus, was known for having an Incestuous love for his daughter, and had killed every man, at this point 13, who had tried to win her hand. When Pelops asked to marry Hippodamia Oenomaus challanged him to a chariot race, with the conditon being death if he lost. There are different versions of the actual races events, but everyone involves Pelops chating. In one version Pelops uses his favour with Poseidon to convince the god to help him cheat in the race, while in another he convinces Oenomaus' charioteer, Myrtilus, a son of Hermes to betray his master. In this version Pelops throws Myrtilus of a cliff to keep him quiet, and Myrtilus as he falls is the one who utters the curse which plauges Pelops' family.
