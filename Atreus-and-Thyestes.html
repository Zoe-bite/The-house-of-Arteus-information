<h2 class= underline hspace= "200px">Atreus</h2>
<p> Atreus was the oldest son of Pelops and Hippodamia; he is remembered as mad murderer with a reign as king unrivaled for the amount of blood spilled and lives taken. The myth of Atrues starts (in most versions) with the terrible murder of his stepbrother, Chrysippus, an act that would lead him down a bloody path, and eventually to his death. Atrues killed Chrysippus along side his brothers Thyestes (mentioned on the site) and Alcathous (not mentioned) out of fear of his succession to the throne. For this bloody act the three brothers were driven from their kingdom of Pisa, after which Alcathous went his seperate ways from  Atreus and Thyestes. Atreus and Thyestes stayed together and found their way to the kingdom of Mycenae, the place soon to be the site of their future atrocities and battles for kingship. At the time of the brothers arrival the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, was away fighting the heracleidae leaving the people in search of a king. The Delphic oracle advised the people to pick between one of the pelopids, Atreus or thystes. Thystes manipulates Atreus into making him king, which Atreus discovers soon after and goes to seek advice from Zeus. Atreus, post divine intervention, is made the rightful king of Mycenae, and thus begins a complicated chain of crimes over the throne. Atreus kills his own son, Pleisthenes, because of Thyestes; kills and butchers his newphew(s) then presents them to Thyestes (their father) for dinner;  is chated on by his wife with his brother; rasies his brother's child, Aegisthus, thinking it's his; and is ultimately killed by his brothers son, Aegisthus, who he raised.<p>
