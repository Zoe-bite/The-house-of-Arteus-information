 <p> Tantalus is the first member of the house of Arteus. He was the king of Sipylus, and a son of Zeus. Tantalus is best known for the myth Tantalus’ punishment; a myth which can trace back the origin of the curse which plagues the future generations of his house.</p> 
<br>
<p>This myth depicts Tantalus’ fateful dinner with the gods of Olympos, during which he tries to trick the gods into committing sacrilege. Ancient Greek religion had a staunch code of morality to do with respect of family members and the dead, including strict rules against famillicide and cannibalism. Tantalus in his efforts to outwit the gods broke both sacred rules and killed his son Pelops to serve at dinner. His plan was to trick the gods into eating a human therefore breaking their own commands, however he was discovered. This act of trickery and breaking of sacred commands is (generally) considered the cause of his house's curse. Pelops was revived by the gods, and Tantelus was sent to Hades’ for eternal punishment, of which he is best known for. After his fathers death, Pelops become king of Siplyus, however the curse already placed would continue to plague his children and grandchildren.</p>
